        <h1>The Process</h1>
        <h2>First Step: Let's chat!</h2>
        <p>Before we get started on anything we need to see if we vibe. During a free discovery call, we will complete a client survey and I will ask you a few questions to see what you need and how I can best help you. Make sure to ask me any burning questions you may have! If it feels like we are a great fit we can move on to the next step!</p>

        <h2>Second Step: Proposal, Contract, & Payments.</h2>
        <p>Once we have figured out that we are a perfect match to work together, you will receive a proposal outlining what we're going to work on (project scope), how long it's going to take (project timeline), and how much it's going to cost you (investment). Once you have accepted the proposal, you will sign a contract that covers us both legally in case of any issues. Once you have signed the contract and paid the initial investment you will reserve a spot on my calender. Most initial investments are 25% of the total cost of the project.</p>

        <h2>Third Step: Do Your Homework!</h2>
        <p>After you have signed the contract and paid the initial invoice, you will be required to do some homework. Don't worry, it's pretty easy! I will provide you with a homework package that will help me to learn more about your specific needs and goals. I will require all homework to be completed before your scheduled start date, or you will have to forfeit your spot and be placed at the end of the queue, which would be super unfortunate. Make sure you get it done in time, it's very important! If you don't understand something feel free to reach out to me with questions!</p>

        <h2>Fourth Step: Research & Strategy</h2>
        <p>After your homework is completed and before I get started, we will meet up through a video chat and we will go over more details. I'll go over your homework with you and we will work together to come up with a clear direction to take with your brand, design, or website. We will hash out some of the details and you will give me your yes's and no's. I will take all that info and do some extra research. Make sure to hit me with any extra questions you have!</p>

        <h2>Fifth Step: Collaborations & Revisions</h2>
        <p>After my research stage I will get to work creating your designs. I will send you regular updates on my progress, as well as give you multiple opportunities to approve or request revisions to the designs.<br>
        During a branding process, most digital design elements (logos, graphics, typography, etc.) will offer a selection of designs to choose from as well as include 3 rounds of revisions before the final approval, where you can request tweaks and changes. We will work together to make sure it's exactly what you want and represents your brand perfectly!<br>
        Web design projects include 2 rounds of revisions before the final design approval. Once the design is approved and finalized I will get to work coding your website.<br><br>During a web development project or stage, you will hear from me a bit less often as I work away writing your custom code. I will update you weekly as to what is going on, but there will be a bit less to show off until it's completed. Rest assured I am working hard! Once development is done there will be one more revision stage before final approval, just to make sure everything is where you want it, works properly, and looks fabulous. Please note that any major changes to design during the development stage can be a <strong>lot</strong> of work and can end up racking up additional costs based on an hourly rate. This is why we have so many design revisions before we get to the development stage.</p>

        <h2>Sixth Step: Finishing Up</h2>
        <p>After the final approval of your project I will send the final invoice. Once the final invoice is paid in full, I will complete the final steps according to the work done.<br> For branding and design packages I will send you all of your digital materials, designs, and optional deliverables.<br> For website design and/or development I will thoroughly bug test your site, install and implement basic SEO, and finally upload your website and make it live. I will then hand over the passwords and information you need to take control and it will become yours! Hurray!<br>I will also provide you with some training so you know how to fully take advantage of all of the features of your new website and won't be left wondering what to do or how to make changes.</p>

      <div class="faq-questions">
        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

          <h2>Are there payment options available?</h2>
          <p>Yes! While you do save money when paying in full, there are simple payment plans available on all of my large packages.<br> Payment plans are set to 4 equal payments based upon your project timeline.<br>
          A minimum of %25 of your total project cost is required up front to secure your spot on my calendar.<br>
          The second payment is due before your strategy session video chat.<br>
          The third payment is due by your pre-scheduled design start date.<br>
          The fourth and final payment is due before your final project is released to you.</p>

          <h2>What about smaller projects?</h2>
          <p>For smaller design projects such as logo creation, social media templates or ads, business card design, etc. payments are expected to be paid in full before work commences. All deliverable services will have 3 rounds of revisions before final approval.<br><br>
          For smaller web development services such as minor fixes, SEO tweaks, etc. work will be charged at an hourly rate. After an initial consultation, a rough estimate will be provided before work starts. A deposit is expected before I start work and the rest is to be paid in full after the work is completed. If I happen to get the work done in less time than initially estimated, I will be sure to pass on the savings to you! If a small project starts to turn into a much larger one than expected and begins to exceed the initial estimate, I will consult with you about how to proceed before continuing work. Don't worry, I won't let costs skyrocket without your consent.</p>

          <h2>Do you have a return policy?</h2>
          <p>Unfortunately, not really.
          <br>Do to the nature of design and development projects there are no refunds once the project has begun. Please make sure that you are committed to your project before signing the contract and paying your initial deposit. I spend a lot of time researching, designing, and developing and pour my heart into all the work that I do. Because of the time spent on your project, I can't offer refunds as I can't get that time back to work on other projects.<br>
          All initial deposits are non-refundable.<br>
          In extreme circumstances, you may apply to cancel your contract.<br> You may only apply for a project cancellation before your second payment is due before your strategy session. In special circumstances, I may decide to keep your initial deposit but cancel all subsequent payments and dissolve the contract if you can no longer continue with the project.<br> Cancellations will only be accepted on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <h2>How soon should I book?</h2>
          <p>As soon as possible!<br>
          Projects run in weekly increments and I can be booked months in advance. I dedicate all my time and energy to one client at a time to provide a true one-on-one tailored experience. You should try to book your start date based on your availability to complete your required homework and based on your payment schedule.<br>
          Make sure to do your homework!<br>
          If your homework is not completed by the project start date you will forfeit your spot and will be moved to the back of the queue.</p>


          <h2>What if I don't like the designs?</h2>
          <p>This is a totally legitimate concern.<br>That's why we make sure we vibe well initially and that you like the type of work I do before you commit to anything.<br>
          Through your homework and strategy session we will hash out many of the details to make sure we are headed in the right direction before I even start designing. I then do a bunch of research to work out even more details based on your preferences and vision. Once work has begun you will have plenty of opportunities to provide ideas, suggest changes, and tweak your designs until you absolutely love them. If you still aren't satisfied after you have used up all of your included revisions, I am still available to revise the designs as many times as you need based on an hourly rate. Don't worry, I will work on it until you are completely satisfied, in love with your new designs, and excited to show them off!</p>

          <h2>How do I schedule a call?</h2>
