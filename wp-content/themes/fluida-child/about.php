            <h6>Hello, I’m Natalie Rose.</h6>
            <p>If you are running a small business or blog, you know that a great website is paramount and one of the most important investments you can make in yourself.</h3>
            <p>Nothing loses potential clients or subscribers faster than a poorly crafted, slow, or hard to navigate website. With a huge amount of users now accessing the web on mobile devices, having a responsive website that scales properly can be make or break for your business. Don't be one of those websites that is too slow to load or so frustrating to use on a mobile that people give up and look elsewhere.<br> I have solutions!</p>

          <h5>Websites are relatively easy to create.</h5>
          <p>There are so many templates and do-it-yourself tutorials online. You could spend years perusing all of the info on the web. I admire people who can start with no knowledge and build themselves a great website from scratch, and I know how much work it takes to learn tech skills!</p><br>
          <p><span>If you are struggling to understand the code,</span><br> or can’t figure out how to add features not standard in a plugin or WordPress theme you may need some professional help. I know how complicated it can be to add what seems like should be an easy addition to your blog, or how frustrating it can get to try to organize searches for the products you sell. If you want to change your static HTML or WordPress website to a responsive design, that can be an incredible amount of work, especially if you are not comfortable with code.</p><br>

            <h4>This is my passion and my own path to freedom.</h4>
            <h5>It’s what I love to do.</h5>
            <p>I decided to embrace my own dreams of working for myself back in 2016 and have since completed a year of front-end development and WordPress development.</p><br>
            <p>I love this beautiful planet and strive to be as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible. When I’m not online or neck deep in code, I spend as much time as possible exploring the wild nooks and spectacular vistas nature has to offer.</p><br>
            <p>On my off time you can find me wandering the forests, climbing mountains, swimming in the ocean, and tubing down rivers. <br>If you want to see more of this side of me check out my lifestyle blog filled with my adventures, my love of the outdoors, and self-sustainability tips like working with essential oils, gardening, and DIY projects.</p>
            <p>Give me some love on social media or browse my pics on instagram!</p><br>
