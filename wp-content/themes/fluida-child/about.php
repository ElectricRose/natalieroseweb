            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <h5>I chose to blaze my own path to freedom!</h5>
            <p>After many years of working for other companies, I'd had enough. I finally realized that I was not meant to work a regular 9-5 job. I wanted to be my own boss and in charge of my own future! As a business owner, I bet that you can relate! I decided I would break out of the rat race and charge head first onto the path of self-employment. It took a lot of hard work, a lot of continuous learning, and a lot of determination to get where I am today. I'm very proud of the business that I've built, and love to help other aspiring entrepreneurs do the same.</p><br>
            <p>I have been working hard and taking a variety of design, development, and coding courses since 2016. Lately, I have been learning more advanced JavaScript and have been diving into marketing and advertising techniques. I'm continuously learning and challenging myself to be able to offer you more and better services.</p><br>
            <h5>I am passionate about what I do.</h5>
             <p>I love to support small businesses and service providers to achieve their own goals by providing them with instrumental tools to success. I understand the financial pressures of self-employment and small business. That's why I keep my prices lower than average. I want to serve my local and wider communities well, while also being able to feed my family.</p><br>
            <h5>I love this beautiful planet.</h5>
            <p>I strive to be as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible. When I’m not online or neck deep in code, I spend as much time as possible exploring the wild nooks and spectacular vistas nature has to offer. </p><br>
            <p>On my off time, you can find me wandering the forests, climbing mountains, swimming in the ocean, and tubing down rivers.</p>
            <p> I'm also a huge DIY fan & sci-fi lover who loves to garden, forage, & preserve my homemade goodies. I love to travel, sing loudly, make my own essential oil products, slap paint on canvas, &  generally enjoy life to the fullest!</p><br>
            <p>I believe in love, laughter, positive energy, & good times.</p>
            <h5>Want to see more of me?</h5>
            <p>Give me some love on social media or browse my pics on Instagram!</p><br>
